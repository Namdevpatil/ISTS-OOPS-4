3. Polymorphism: one entity in many forms.

	=> static/compile time polymorphism: we can implement this type of polymorphism with,
		1. constructor overloading:
		2. method overloading
		
		Note: for method or constructor overloading we need only one class.
		
	=> dynamic/run time polymorphism: we can implement this type of polymorphism with,
		1. method overriding

4. Abstraction: Hide unnecessory things focus on the functionality.
